<h1>Welcome to Scott's Epic Hikes</h1>

<p class="intro">I really got into hiking in about 1994, when a friend of mine and I decided one weekend that we should go to Yosemite and hike Half Dome. I had heard about this hike as being one of the most major hikes in Yosemite that did not require any special rock-climbing skills (which I did not have), and I managed to persuade my friend Steve to accompany me on this journey. That one summer trip that we took, which involved an 11-hour hike covering 17 miles and 4,800 feet of gain and descent, started a long love for hiking and has taken me to many cool, scenic summits throughout California. Below are some of the trips I have taken.</p>

<section id="whitney">
<h2>Mt. Whitney</h2>

<p>This was one of my proudest summits. I hiked this with a few friends of mine in the summer of 1997. Mt. Whitney, at 14,505 feet above sea level, is the highest mountain in the lower 48 states in the United States. It involves over 6,000 feet of elevation gain from the trailhead, and it is one of the most popular hikes in the country, if not the world. This was a rough year in general for me, as my sister Pam was terminally ill at the time that we ascended, and I spoke to her on the phone from the trailhead while she was in the hospital. She passed away about one month later. So what was an otherwise very sad year, hiking Mt. Whitney was, literally and figuratively, the high point.</p>

<section id="dana">
<h2>Mt. Dana</h2> 

<p>Mt. Dana, at 13,102 feet above sea level, is the second-highest mountain in Yosemite National Park. It involves climbing about 3,000 feet in a distance of 3.5 miles above Tioga Pass, and most of route involves a mixture of trail and semi-stable scree. From the summit, you can look west and see much of the granite-composed mountains of Tuolumne Meadows (a real rock-climbing Mecca!) and the view to the east is the highly alkaline Mono Lake. We had hiked this mountain the day after hiking another mountain called Cloud's Rest, which made for a very strenuous hiking weekend.</p>

<section id="rose">
<h2>Mt. Rose</h2>

<p>Mt. Rose is one of the highest mountains in the Lake Tahoe Region. It dominates the mountains in the Northeastern region of Lake Tahoe. The hike involves about 1,800 feet of gain in about five miles, making for a half-day excursion. I would say this is the shortest and easiest of the four hikes featured on this page.</p>

</section>

<section id="tallac">
<h2>Mt. Tallac</h2>

<p>Mt. Tallac is another of the highest peaks in the Lake Tahoe region, but it is on the opposite side of the lake from Mt. Rose. The hike is close to ten miles roundtrip and involves over 3,000 feet of gain.</p>

<p>One of my most frequently-visited sites that contains quite a bit of information about hiking is <a href="http://www.summitpost.org" target="_blank">Summitpost.org</a>. I really like this site because of the way it categorizes the content in many logical ways, based on a user's interests. For example, there is a page for <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/mount-tallac/150430" target="_blank">Mt. Tallac</a>. In addition to all of the sections in the main frame of the page (Overview, Main Routes, Directions to get there, trailheads, etc.), there is also a sidebar that has links for other routes, other mountains in the vicinity, trip reports, and other very useful resources for the avid hiker. The site also has a forum for meeting up with other hikers and planning trips. I met a couple of my best friends through this site.</p>

<p>There really wasn't too much in the source code that I was unfamiliar with, as I've been a front-end developer for a while, but I see that there is an <ins></ins> tag, which seems to load a rotating google ad. I see a United banner because they are trying to do damage control from their latest incident. The next two times I reloaded, there was a Baskin Robbins banner as well as a Merrell hiking boots banner.</p>
